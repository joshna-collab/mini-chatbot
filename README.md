An end-to-end chatbot using python, started this task by importing necessary python libraries.
Added more intends to make the chatbot more functional and train the machine learning model.
Wrote a python function to chat with the chatbot.
Till now chatbot is created . after running the code, this can be interacted in the terminal itself... For that it should be deploied first.
I used streamlit library to deploy
